# Emotion-Detection

Here I have used Fer2013 and CK+ dataset to do emotion detection. 
The emotions were divided into 7 classes: 0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral

This was implemented using two methods:
1) PCA and SVM
2) CNN 

Accuracies of both the datsets along with the above mentioned models was implemented.
